2. **For Production**: 
   - Implement inventory management
   - Add proper error handling
   - Enhance security measures
   - Add admin functionality

3. **For Future Development**:
   - Consider implementing a REST API
   - Add payment gateway integration
   - Implement caching for better performance
   - Add analytics tracking

## Testing Notes

- Authentication flow works correctly
- Cart functionality works for logged-in users
- Guests are properly redirected to login
- Orders are saved to database correctly
- UI is responsive and user-friendly
- Database structure is properly implemented with all necessary tables and relationships
- Database table inconsistency issue has been resolved (previously 'user_cart' now correctly 'cart')
- Homepage now features dynamic category shortcuts that rotate periodically
- Homepage sections are well-spaced with improved visual flow
- Homepage has enhanced visual appeal with vibrant design and personality
- JavaScript errors have been fixed by moving code to appropriate locations

## Conclusion

The GemCart project is in good shape for a prototype. All core functionality works as expected, and the authentication flow properly restricts cart access to logged-in users only. The database implementation is correct with proper table structures and relationships. The project can be used as-is for demonstration purposes, with enhancements that can be added incrementally based on requirements.
