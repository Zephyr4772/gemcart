# Homepage Image Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated index.php

Modified the homepage to dynamically display random images from each category:

#### Added Function

  - First tries to get a random product image from the database for the category
  - Falls back to selecting a random image from the category folder in `assets/`
  - Uses a placeholder image if no images are found

#### Updated Featured Categories Section
- Modified the dynamic category shortcuts to use actual images instead of placeholders
- Images now change daily along with the category rotation

#### Added Category Carousel Section
- Implemented a new carousel section that displays categories with images
- Uses the same random image selection logic

#### Updated Carousel Data
- Modified the carousel data to use actual category images instead of placeholders

#### IMAGE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md
- Comprehensive guide to how the image system works

#### HOMEPAGE_IMAGE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md

## How It Works

### Image Selection Process
1. When the homepage loads, it determines which categories to display based on the day of the year
2. For each category, the system calls `getRandomCategoryImage()` to select an appropriate image
3. The selection follows this priority:
   - Random product image from the database
   - Random image from the category folder
   - Placeholder image as fallback

### Daily Rotation
- The featured categories rotate every 24 hours
- Images rotate with the categories
- Each day shows a different set of categories with their respective images

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Content**: Homepage now shows real product images instead of placeholders
2. **Automatic Updates**: Images change daily with category rotation
3. **Fallback System**: Ensures images always display even if some are missing
4. **Easy Management**: Adding new images is as simple as placing them in the correct folder
5. **Performance**: Efficient image selection with proper fallbacks

## Testing

The changes have been tested and verified:
- Images load correctly from the database
- Fallback to category folder images works
- Placeholder images display when needed
- Daily rotation functions properly
- No JavaScript errors in CSS files

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Implement caching for image selection to improve performance
2. **Admin Interface**: Create an admin interface for managing category images
3. **Image Optimization**: Add automatic image resizing and optimization
4. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for carousel images
