# Image Renaming Summary

All product images have been renamed to follow the standardized naming convention and organized into appropriate folders.

## New Naming Convention:

- `assets/necklaces/`
- `assets/earrings/`
- `assets/bracelets/`
- `assets/watches/`
- `assets/gold/`
- `assets/silver/`
- `assets/platinum/`
